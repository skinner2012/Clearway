"""Eval aggregation — fold per-finding `CitationCheck`s into the trust metrics.

M1 wraps a stratified set of trust metrics in a reproducible `OnlineEvalReport` (ARCHITECTURE §4.5):
the overall `citation_hallucination_rate` plus its split by oracle-verifiability — the verifiable
rate (~0 by construction) and the `unverifiable_share` (the honest headline). The checks are read
from each `Trace.checks` (the authoritative per-finding record), not a side list.

`evaluate` reads `run_id` / `config_id` off the traces (they live there); the
report labels — `eval_set_id`, `oracle_regime`, `oracle_version`, `created_at` —
are passed in by the caller (the orchestrator, T10), since the oracle has already
done its job by this point and `eval/` holds no oracle of its own.
